The Library Book Inventory System is a simple CRUD application developed in the C programming language.
It allows library staff or users to manage books dynamically using a linked list data structure.
Each book record includes an ID, name, author, and availability status.
The system supports operations like adding new books, updating existing book details, deleting books, and listing all available books.
This project is a great introduction to data structures, particularly linked lists, and dynamic memory management in C.
It demonstrates how structured data can be handled efficiently using pointers and user-defined structures.

Start the program

Displays a menu with options to add, update, delete, or view books.

Add a Book

User provides ID, name, author, and availability status.

Exit

Ends the program.
